Checkers Game with Python

Artificial intelligence project

Checkers game using Alpha-beta pruning algorithm.

The game of checkers is considered a complicated game with 10^20 possible legal positions in the English
draughts version (8*8 board) alone (much more on higher dimensions). Our approach is to create a computer
agent based on the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm, together with possible improvements, which is the state of the art in
one-on-one games. We start from implementing a basic minimax player with a basic evaluation heuristic, and
step by step we improve the pruning by implementing alpha-beta pruning and in addition, we improve our
evaluation function to reach better approximation of the value of the position for our computer player.
